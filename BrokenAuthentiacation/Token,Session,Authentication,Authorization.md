##### hint

The Name of `Authentication Header` is ` Authorization`

### Difference Between Token and session

##### Token

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a proposed standard for creating tokens with a `JSON` payload that includes various claims and can be signed using a `private secret` or a `public/private` key. These tokens are authorization files that can be optionally signed or encrypted, generated by the server using a `secret key`, and `stored locally` by the user. Tokens are sent to the server with `every new request`, which is verified by the server to authorize the requests.

EX:

a server could generate a token that has the claim `logged in as administrator` and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as administrator

Structure:

```js
Header:
    {
      "alg": "HS256",
      "typ": "JWT"
    }
Payload:
    {
      "loggedInAs": "admin",
      "iat": 1422779638
    }
Signature:
    HMAC_SHA256(
      secret,
      base64urlEncoding(header) + '.' +
      base64urlEncoding(payload)
    )
```

###### Session

is a small file, most likely in `JSON format`, that stores information about the user, such as a `unique ID`, `time of login and expirations`, and so on. It is generated and `stored on the server` so that the server can keep track of  the user requests. The user receives some of these details, especially the ID, as coo

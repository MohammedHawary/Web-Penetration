### Exploiting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

To demonstrate XSS vulnerability, a common method is to create a popup using the `alert()` function. This isn't because XSS is related to popups; it's a way to show that you can run arbitrary JavaScript on a specific domain. Some may use `alert(document.domain)` to clarify the executing domain.

Sometimes, it's necessary to go beyond proof and provide a complete exploit to illustrate the severity of an XSS vulnerability. In this section, we'll delve into three widely used and potent methods to exploit an XSS vulnerability.

### Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies

Exploiting XSS to steal cookies is a traditional method. Since many web apps use cookies for session management, an attacker can use XSS to send the victim's cookies to their domain and impersonate the victim by injecting these cookies into the browser.

However, this approach has limitations:

- The victim may not be logged in.
- Some apps protect cookies using the `HttpOnly` flag, making them inaccessible to JavaScript.
- Additional security measures, like locking sessions to the user's IP address, can thwart attacks.
- The session may expire before the attacker can hijack it.

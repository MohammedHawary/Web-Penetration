# Race conditions

**Race conditions** are a vulnerability linked to **business logic flaws**. They happen when websites process concurrent requests without safeguards, leading to multiple threads interacting with the same data simultaneously. This collision triggers unintended behavior in the application. A race condition attack exploits this behavior by carefully timed requests to cause intentional collisions for malicious purposes.
